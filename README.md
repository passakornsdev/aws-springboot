### Add external services for your application
Like MongoDB, you can add any services on your local development
Simply by defining services in compose.yaml - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/#step-2-define-services-in-a-compose-file)

### MongoDB initial Data

- Add json file in ./mongodb-dumb

- Each new row, u can use online oid generator https://observablehq.com/@hugodf/mongodb-objectid-generator

- Add mongoimport command with correct database, collection and file path in compose.yaml


à¸º Beware of the import command, it will fail after it is successfully executed once because duplicated OID, but new item with new OID will pass
